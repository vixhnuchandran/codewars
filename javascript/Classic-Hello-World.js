// You are given a method called main, make it print the line Hello World!, 
// (yes, that includes a new line character at the end) and don't return anything
// Note that for some languages, the function main is the entry point of the program.


//My solution
class Solution {
    static main() {
        console.log("Hello World!");
    }
}
